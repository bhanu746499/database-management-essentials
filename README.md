### File Organization Structure

`ica_diagrams` contains reference diagrams for the database used in modules 3, 4, and 5. The database is named `ica` and is short-hand for the *Intercollegiate Athletic* Database. It contains information necessary to schedule and offer events through the Intercollegiate Athletic Department.

The rest of the folders are organized by module, each containing their own `README` file describing the assigned problems and key lessons learned for that module.
