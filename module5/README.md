# Module 5

## Key Lessons

This module primarily taught:

 1. How to use `SELECT` statement to make more complex queries joining a greater number of tables.
 2. Set operators in SQL such as `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS`. with their associated Venn Diagram visualizations.
 3. Different types of query formulation errors:

Syntax errors:

 - Won't execute because of the compiler
 - May give confusing messages
 - Easy to detect

Semantic errors:

 - Executes a valid query, but obtains incorrect results
 - May cause excessive resource usage
 - Most subtle to detect because query is valid

Redundancy errors:

 - Executes a valid query and obtains the correct rows
 - Causes excessive resource usage

## Practice Problems

All practice problems and related answers are located in `practice_problems.sql` and cover `SELECT` queries accessing two or more tables, as well as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements. Problems reference tables in the ICA database.

## Graded Assignment

All problems in the graded assignment and related answers are located in `graded_assignment.sql` and cover slightly more complex `SELECT` queries accessing up to five tables, as well as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements. Problems also reference tables in the ICA database.
